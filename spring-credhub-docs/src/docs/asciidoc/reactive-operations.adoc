== Introduction to ReactiveCredHubOperations

The interface `org.springframework.credhub.core.ReactiveCredHubOperations` and the implementation `org.springframework.credhub.core.ReactiveCredHubTemplate` are the central classes in Spring CredHub reactive support.
`ReactiveCredHubOperations` provides access to additional operations interfaces that model the full CredHub API:

[source,java,%autofit]
----
/**
 * Get the operations for saving, retrieving, and deleting credentials.
 */
ReactiveCredHubCredentialOperations credentials();

/**
 * Get the operations for adding, retrieving, and deleting credential permissions.
 */
ReactiveCredHubPermissionOperations permissions();

/**
 * Get the operations for adding, retrieving, and deleting credential permissions.
 */
ReactiveCredHubPermissionV2Operations permissionsV2();

/**
 * Get the operations for retrieving, regenerating, and updating certificates.
 */
ReactiveCredHubCertificateOperations certificates();

/**
 * Get the operations for interpolating service binding credentials.
 */
ReactiveCredHubInterpolationOperations interpolation();

/**
 * Get the operations for retrieving CredHub server information.
 */
ReactiveCredHubInfoOperations info();

=== Mapping to CredHub API

Each method of the `Reactive...Operations` interfaces maps directly to one endpoint of the CredHub HTTP API.
The following table shows the mapping between the CredHub API and the appropriate Spring CredHub `Reactive...Operations` interface.

=== ReactiveCredHubOperations Auto-configuration

A `ReactiveCredHubOperations` Spring bean is created using Spring Boot auto-configuration when application properties are properly configured and the Spring WebFlux library is on the classpath.
Application classes can autowire an instance of this bean to interact with a CredHub server.
