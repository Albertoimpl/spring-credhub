[[abstract]]

Spring CredHub provides client-side support for storing, retrieving, and deleting credentials from a {credhub-home}[CredHub] server running in a {cloudfoundry-home}[Cloud Foundry] platform.

CredHub provides an {credhub-api-home}[HTTP API] to securely store, generate, retrieve, and delete credentials of various types. Spring CredHub provides a Java binding for the CredHub API, making it easy to integrate Spring applications with CredHub.
